# Discogs Most Wanted

This is a sketch for a storytelling-supported visualization tool about the demand for selected records on the music release database and trading platform Discogs. It uses the Discogs API, Svelte, d3.js, scrollama and gsap.

It is a work in progress and I am still working on a few issues: 
- Zooming controls
- Dynamic search for lists
- directing the users' attention to my personal favorites and more interesting outliers
